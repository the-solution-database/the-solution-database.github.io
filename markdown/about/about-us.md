# About "The Solution Database"

One late afternoon, I had a tech problem, now, normally, I solve it and move on pretty easily, but today, I thought for a minute.

"Why are there so many places to get solutions, and why do barely any of them work????" was the exact thing I thought to myself.

Then I decided, I want to make a database with a compilation of every technological problem + solutions I can think of, to make it, I shall scour the interwebs and find all the solutions to problems people didn't even know existed.

That was my inspiration for "The Solution Database," a straightforward, no bloat website to solve all your technological problems in an easy to navigate manner.

Thank you to all those people who put out those solutions to begin with, you saved many lives, and now you will save many, many more.
