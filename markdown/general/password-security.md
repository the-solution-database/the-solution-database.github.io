# Password Security: Securing Your Place on the Web

## But why?

Look, you have all heard the must-do password security measures, picking a different password for each site, making sure it's a secure password, etc.  
But what if I told you that barely anyone actually pays attention to these? The two most used passwords in the world are `123456` followed by `password`, and people wonder why their accounts get hacked.

Password security doesn't have to be the hassle that everyone thinks it is, and here’s how.

## What dictates a good password?

A good password is a secure password that can't be hacked by an eight-year-old guessing passwords in his room.

Here's what it needs to look like:
- **Not on the list of top passwords**  
  (Not just the top 1,000, but it shouldn't be anything that is in the top 10,000 most used passwords)
- **Not something other people know**  
  (No, your dog's name is not a good password, nor is `firstpetname1`, nor is adding two digits to the end of your name and calling it a day)
- **At least 6-7 characters long**  
  (Longer passwords are exponentially harder to crack, 6-7 characters is fine, but aim for 10 or 12+)
- **A mix of characters**  
  (Uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols — yes, throw in that `!` or `@` for fun)
- **Not reused anywhere else**  
  (If one site gets compromised and you reuse that password, everything else goes down like dominoes)

## Tools that make your life easier

Managing a hundred different passwords sounds like a nightmare, but don't worry, you aren't expected to remember them all by heart, sure you can try, but believe me it probably won't work. But that’s where tools come in:
- **Password Managers**  
  Use tools like Bitwarden, 1Password, or KeePass to store and generate secure passwords for every account. You only need to remember *one* master password — the rest are handled for you. I recommend [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com) if you plan on having your passwords stored in the cloud (online), and I highly recommend [KeePassXC](https://keepassxc.org/) if you want to have your passwords stored locally and safely on your own computer. If you are on mobile, try one of the mobile KeePass apps like keepass2android on Android phones.

- **Browser Integration**  
  Most modern browsers can help you generate and store strong passwords. Plus most password managers offer browser extensions to interconnect your browser to your password manager. While not perfect, it's a decent step up from "ilovecookies123".

- **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**  
  Always enable 2FA where possible. It acts as a second lock on your digital door. Even if someone gets your password, they can’t get in without the second factor. I highly recommend [2FAS](https://2fas.com/), which is an amazing and completely free two-factor authentication app with built-in backup support, to backup your 2FA codes incase you lose access to your phone.

## Final Thoughts

Password security isn’t just about being cautious — it’s about being realistic. Threats are everywhere, and lazy password habits are an open invitation. You don’t have to memorize 150 complex passwords, but you *do* need a strategy. Let technology do the heavy lifting, and lock down your online life before someone else takes control of it.

Seriously, don’t be the guy whose email password is `password1234`. You’re better than that.
