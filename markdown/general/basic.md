# Simple Solutions to Simple Problems

The ***#1*** solution to every problem: before trying anything, make sure to try out the phrase as old as computers themselves, "have you tried turning it off and on again?"

If there a tech problem, the first step is to try restarting it, try closing and reopening the app or website, try turning your computer off and then turning it back on again.
You only move on to potential other solutions when:
A) Turning it off and on again doesn't work
B) You are in a scenario where you *can't* safely turn it off and on again
