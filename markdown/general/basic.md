# Simple Solutions to Simple Problems

## Step 1: The Obvious

The ***#1*** solution to every problem: before trying anything, make sure to try out the phrase as old as computers themselves, "have you tried turning it off and on again?"

If there is a tech problem, the first step is to try restarting the cause of it, try closing and reopening the app or website, try turning your computer off and then turning it back on again.
You only move on to potential other solutions when:\
A) Turning it off and on again doesn't work\
B) You are in a scenario where you *can't* safely turn it off and on again

## Step 2: Identify the Type of Problem

If you fit either of those two scenarios where rebooting just won't save you, you have to find the *type of problem* that you are dealing with. Ask yourself:

- **Is this a hardware issue?**  
  (e.g. screen is black, keyboard unresponsive, fan not spinning)
- **Is this a software issue?**  
  (e.g. app crashing, weird error messages, some app just not working right)
- **Is it a connectivity issue?**  
  (e.g. Wi-Fi won't connect, website not loading, online service down)
- **Is it user error?**  
  (Be honest to yourself. Did you maybe forget a password or click the wrong button?)

Once you narrow down the issue, it will be ***A LOT*** easier to solve it instead of throwing random solutions at the wrong kind of problem.

## Step 3: Search for the Exact Problem

If there is an error message, take it and **copy and paste it** into a search engine like Google or DuckDuckGo. Seriously. Copy paste exactly, word for word. Don’t try paraphrasing.

If there’s no error message to use, describe the problem in *detail* like:

- `"Windows 11 taskbar not responding after update"`
- `"Phone won’t connect to Wi-Fi, says 'authentication error'"`
- `"Mac won’t boot past Apple logo"`

Chances are, someone has already had the exact same problem and posted it, and has had it answered. Reddit, Stack Overflow, Microsoft/Apple/Android forums, and random tech blogs are all very helpful. And of course, this website, a treasure trove of every solution from across every forum!

## Step 4: Try the Common Fixes

Most issues have a list of classic go-to fixes. Here are a few:

### For Internet Issues
- Restart the router
- Forget and reconnect to the Wi-Fi
- Try a different device to see if it is a device or Wi-Fi issue.

### For Crashing Apps
- Clear cache/app data (especially on phones)
- Check for app updates
- Reinstall the app

### For Unusual Behavior
- Install all system updates
- Scan for malware/viruses

## Step 5: Ask for Help (Correctly)

If nothing works and you are at a loss, it is always just fine to ask the interwebs for help, don't just say "it's broken," provide in depth details **ALWAYS.** Provide the following information:

- What device/OS/software you're using (and what version you are on)
- What exactly the problem is
- What you’ve already tried that didn't work
- Any error messages or other helpful information (such as logs)

A well formulated question doesn't look like `"When I click this button it doesn't work"`, it looks more like `"After changing these settings: ___, ___ doesn't work, I am on version ____ of the app ____, here is the error: ____, and I have attached a file containing the logs. I tried to ____ but it didn't solve my problem`.

Good help comes faster to people who put in a little bit more effort.
